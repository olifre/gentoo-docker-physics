gentoo-docker-physics

Trying to provide a set of docker-containers built by travis automagically, 
finally targeting a gentoo-based container with a toolset for particle physics. 
This involves ROOT 6, Geant 4 and more. 
All docker-containers are built from branches, master will stay empty for now.
